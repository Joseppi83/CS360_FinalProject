Time for Family Android App

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements are the Android SDS.  

This app addressed the needs of busy families.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
At this basic stage, it just needed a landing screen, event listing screen, and settings screen.  

It kept them in mind by attempting an intuitive design.

My design was successful, because it is basic, without bells and whistles.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I hand sketched a rough draft.  Then, I made a UML diagram and a logic flowchart.  Then, I types pseudocode.  After that, I typed actual code.

I could use these techniques in many ways.  Job or entrepreneurship.  Why even ask that question?

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I mostly used user-based testing, because I'm not that familiar with testing libraries yet.

It's important, because you want your app to function as intended.


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I didn't innovate at all.  This app is as basic as it gets.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
All of it.
